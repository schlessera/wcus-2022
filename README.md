# Getting Started with WP-CLI
> Presentation for [WordCamp US 2022](https://2022.us.wordcamp.org/).

WP-CLI is the command line interface for WordPress. A text-based tool that allows you to control WordPress at scale. It is useful for local development, for remote control of your servers, and for automating menial & not so menial tasks. If you have been convinced that WP-CLI is the right tool to level up your mastery of WordPress, but you’ve had a hard time getting started using it, then this Workshop is for you!

We’ll start by setting up the environment and take a look at the basics of WP-CLI. Then we will slowly dive deeper to understand how you can remotely control multiple servers with the push of a few keystrokes. Finally, we’ll explore how you can progress from manual tasks to fully automated scripts that let you shave minutes, or even hours, off of repetitive tasks. You’ll leave this Workshop with a new tool in your tool belt ready to get you to a new level of productivity.
